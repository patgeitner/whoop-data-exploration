# Personal WHOOP Data Exploration
Exploring my physiological, sleep, workout, and journal data from my personal WHOOP data exports.

WHOOP recently made it easier to export your own data. Each export contains a dataset for your physiological data, sleep data, workout data, and journal data. I would like to eventually have access to the raw data recorded by the sensor, but this is cool for now. This repo will serve as my workspace as I start messing around with my own exports.
